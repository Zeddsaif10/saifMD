# Malware Detection Using Deep Learning

This project explores the application of deep learning techniques for detecting malware in executable files. The dataset used contains structural and behavioral attributes of various files, categorized as benign or malicious. The goal was to build robust classification models capable of distinguishing between these two classes.

## Dataset Overview
Source: Kaggle (PE Files Malware Dataset)
Total Samples: 19,611
Features: 79 columns (file characteristics like section size, header information, import/export directory data, etc.)
Target: Malware (0 - Benign, 1 - Malware)
Models Implemented
Several deep learning models were developed and compared for their performance:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)

Hyperparameter Tuned GCN

Graph Sample and Aggregated (GraphSAGE)

Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)

Graph Attention Network (GAT)


## Process

The workflow followed the CRISP-DM framework:

Data Understanding & Preprocessing: Exploratory analysis, visualization, and removal of irrelevant columns.
Data Balancing: Used SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
Feature Scaling: Standardization applied to ensure consistent input across models.
Model Training: Models were trained using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Evaluation: Models were assessed using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.


## Key Results

The models were compared based on their detection accuracy:

Model	Accuracy
CNN	96.78%
RNN	95.61%
GCN	96.82%
Hyperparameter-tuned GCN	97.22%
GraphSAGE	96.41%
Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)	97.58%
Graph Attention Network (GAT)	96.12%


The Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) achieved the highest accuracy, demonstrating its strong capability to detect subtle patterns in file structure.
Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) outperformed others, achieving an accuracy of 97.58%.
Graph-based models (GCN, GIN, GAT) showed strong potential for malware detection due to their ability to capture structural relationships between features.
CNN and RNN also showed competitive performance, highlighting the importance of sequence and spatial feature extraction.

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates that deep learning, particularly graph-based approaches, can significantly enhance malware detection capabilities. By leveraging structural file characteristics and combining them with deep learning techniques, this project offers a potential blueprint for building more adaptive and accurate malware detection systems.
